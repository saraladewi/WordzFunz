## Programming Concepts Used for This Project

HTML
- A basic, flat html frame is created
- div tag are used in the entire HTML frame to place and hold the contents neatly in place.
-id and class are used to diffentiate some special elements such as buttons, scores and time. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

CSS
- Bootstrap 4.1.3 is used and imported from the Bootstrap CDN for a more nice looking interface and a faster web design.
- Reason Bootstrap selected is because Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)

Javascript(Vanilla JS)
- The index.html is linked to main.js
- DOM is used in this project. The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is selected and manipulated
- array od words are listed in JS for the screen to display random words from the array container.
- setinterval and clearinterval method are used in the project. The setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds).The setInterval() method will continue calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.
- Other structures used in js include: for loop, if/else statement and eddeventListener for the smoothness of the program.

JSON
-JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data sent from a server to a web page
-Reason used JSON : it is a "self-describing" and easy to understand
package.json describes the characteristics of the program such as the name , version, project description and etc which is used to build JS objects.
